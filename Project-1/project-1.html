        <h2 class="title1">The Development of MONOSPACED Font</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p class="p1">> Monospaced fonts are commonly seen in programming development. However, the font was not developed for programming only even though it is designed for utilitarian and sturdy rather than for advertising or decoration. To discuss the development of monospaced fonts. We need to figure out how typewriters work, because the monospaced fonts were born from the limitations of mechanical typewriters. </p>

        <p class="p1">> Just as its name is expressed, monospaced fonts are fonts in which all characters have the same amount of horizontal space. Monospaced fonts were used on typewriters at first because the equal breadth feature allowed typewriters carriage to move the paper the same distance each time when a typist pressed a key, which made the writing process smoothly. Monospaced fonts thrived in the twenty century, a period in which typewriters were widely used in offices and homes. Many monospaced fonts were designed in the first half of the 20th century. Most companies had their own Pica typeface, a monospaced font that fit ten characters to the inch. Among all the monospaced typefaces, Courier, a font released in the year 1956 designed by Howard "Bud" Kettler for IBM's typewriters became the most famous one. By the 1960s, a few years after Courier published, the font became so popular that you could find it almost every where-from screenplays to formal documents. In the next three decades, monospaced fonts became a trend. The monospaced fonts could easily migrate to phototypesetting technology in the 1970s and in the 1980s, they were widely used in computer gaming, especially Courier-it was one of the handfuls of fonts available on personal computers.

           > Typewriters were a standard fixture in most offices up to the 1980s. Thereafter, they began to be largely supplanted by personal computers running word processing software. However, monospaced fonts were still a trend. The fonts could easily migrate to phototypesetting technology; they were widely used in computers, especially Courier-it was one of the handfuls of fonts available on personal computers. More importantly, monospaced fonts were used in programming languages. The font family again benefits from its same-breadth feature, thriving in the coding area, just as it was popular on typewriters.

         <p class="p1">
           > Monospaces fonts became so  popular  in coding because each letter in the fonts takes more places than that of proportional fonts. Programming, in contrast with traditional typography, focuses more on individual characters rather than words or sentences. With the wide space between each character, programmers can recognize bugs easier than locating a specific letter in text with normal typefaces. Moreover, monospaced fonts generally differentiate better between similar characters, such as 0oO, and give more space to important syntactical characters, which make code looks clean.

            > However, the feature also can be a weakness of the typefaces either. Monospaced typefaces are not good typefaces for body text. Compared to proportional fonts, monospaced fonts are harder to read because of the larger, even spaces between letters. And because they take up more horizontal space, youâ€™ll always get fewer words per page with a monospaced font.
